# RayTracing
This project is based on the course project I did in Northwestern University.

The purpose is to
* Add unit tests
* Refactor to be more readable and maintainable
* Enable github.io browser view
* Some future works...

## Unit Test
Unit tests are written in [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/#installation)
